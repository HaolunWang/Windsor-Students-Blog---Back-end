## For back-end

For this project, I used cloud atlas mongoDB.The connection string is coded in app.js which is under 

Windsor Students Blog - Back-end/my-blog-backend folder

from line 14 to 21.

I have built the backend for post function as in the my-blog-backend folder. Here is also a screenshot of it:

As you can see, the server is also running successfully. 


To test the connection with server, cd to my-blog-backend folder, and use the following command:

SET DEBUG=my-blog-backend:* & npm run devstart


Additionally, hereâ€™s a screenshot of the collection in the mongoDB.
