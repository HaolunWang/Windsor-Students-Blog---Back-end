# For front-end part in this project

For this project, I used cloud atlas mongoDB.
The connection string is coded in app.js 
which is under Windsor Students Blog - Back-end/my-blog-backend folder
from line 14 to 21.

I have built the backend for post function as in the my-blog-backend folder. Here is also a screenshot of it: 
As you can see, the server is also running successfully. 
To test the connection with server, cd to my-blog-backend folder, and use the following command:
	SET DEBUG=my-blog-backend:* & npm run devstart
Additionally, hereâ€™s a screenshot of our collection in the mongoDB.
